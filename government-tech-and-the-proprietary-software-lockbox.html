      <h2 id="the-request">The request</h2>
<p>In July, the City of Las Vegas Municipal Court (LVMC) denied my records
request for electronic court records because its data was “proprietary
and owned by [its] vendor, <a href="http://www.nevsys.com/">NevSys</a>”
(<a href="/assets/files/LVMC-20130731.pdf">PDF</a>). In response I cited the Nevada
Electronic Filing and Conversion <a href="http://www.leg.state.nv.us/courtrules/NEFCR.html#NEFCRRule5">Rule
5(j)(2)</a>,
but to no avail. I was advised to review the contract between the City
and Nevsys governing the development of “COURTassist,” the <abbr
title='Las Vegas Municipal Court'>LVMC</abbr>’s Case Management System.</p>
<p>On 29 July I visited the City’s <a href="https://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/Business/doing_business.asp">Purchasing and Contracts
Division</a> at
City Hall and I asked to inspect CLV Contract No. 040396
(<a href="/assets/files/CLV-20130729.pdf">PDF</a>). After some initial confusion
about whether or not citizens may scan a record, or a portion thereof,
during such an inspection (they may), I was informed that the staffer
responsible was not available and I would be unable to inspect the
contract that day. I got in touch with the staffer and set an
appointment to inspect the contract. This was followed by a rather
tedious series of reschedulings over the following weeks.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The City finally turned over 378 pages of contract documents on 19
September. These documents are embedded <a href="#docs">below</a>.</p>
<h2 id="contract-highlights">Contract highlights</h2>
<p>The project to develop COURTassist was overtaken by events and was
delivered over budget and several years behind schedule. In short, City:</p>
<ul>
<li>paid NevSys \$1,037,966 to develop the software;</li>
<li>provided them office space and at least three full-time City
    employees to develop it;</li>
<li>signed over its ownership to NevSys in exchange for a 2% royalty
    payment;</li>
<li>now pays \$134,000/year (indexed to the CPI) to NevSys for support
    and maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also turns out that there are several manuals that were responsive to
the original request. As a comparison, I’m asking other courts in the
area what their licensing and deployment costs were, but I suspect that
the City didn’t do as badly as I had originally thought.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>As reflected in the contract documents, the City’s experience during the
development of the Municipal Court’s <abbr title="Case
Management System">CMS</abbr> spotlights several fundamental problems
with how it and the <abbr title="Nevada Public Records
Act">NPRA</abbr> treats software and electronic records.</p>
<h3 id="the-city-ought-to-have-retained-ownership-of-the-courtassist-source-code">The City ought to have retained ownership of the COURTassist source code</h3>
<p>In my view, the City lost an important opportunity by relinquishing its
ownership in the <abbr title="Case Management System">CMS</abbr> to
NevSys. While the City has until 2016 to recoup its investment it seems
unlikely that it will do so; as far as I can tell, the only other
jurisdiction which adopted this software was Boulder City, Nevada, and
that was at no cost.</p>
<p><em>Ceteris paribus</em>, for what the City has paid it could have kept
ownership of the source code and made it freely (both free as in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">freedom</a> and as in no
cost) available to other cities, with the contractor providing support
just as they are now. Practically speaking, doing so might have saved
taxpayers money in cities across the country and gone some way to
diversifying the market. With the software open, users could customize
it to meet their specific needs, and benefit from the continuous
improvement by the community of users. NevSys could have filled—and
still can—a niche in the market by adopting an open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_models_for_open-source_software">business
model</a>,
such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat">Red Hat’s</a> subscription
model.</p>
<h3 id="proprietary-software-and-open-governance">Proprietary software and open governance</h3>
<p>The difficulty I’ve encountered obtaining data during the course of the
Arrests project underscores the risks to open governance posed by
proprietary software. I only received two outright denials, one from the
<abbr title="Las Vegas Metropolitan Police
Department">lvmpd</abbr>, and the other from the <abbr title="Las
Vegas Municipal Court">LVMC</abbr>. Both claimed that even a mere
listing of the data elements present in their databases constituted
proprietary information that could not be released to the public.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
Both the NevSys and <a href="/notebook/2013/09/lvmpd-database-documents">IAPro</a>
contracts make broad assertions of confidentiality that are immediately
followed by clauses weakly acknowledging the Nevada Public Records Act.
These contortions are required because the democratic principles of
openness and public access which are enshrined in the
<abbr title="Nevada
Public Records Act">NPRA</abbr> are in conflict with the business model
for proprietary software.</p>
<p>The principled argument that free (as in freedom) software should
generally be preferred to closed source proprietary software is one that
I would hope resonates with public sector policymakers and IT managers.
Government agencies need to insist on free software in order to preserve
their control over their own computing. Most government activities now
depend on computing, and an agency’s control over those activities—and
the data they generate—depends on its control over that computing.</p>
<p>While the IAPro contract egregiously cedes total control over the
release of information to the vendor, <a href="http://www.ci-technologies.com/">CI
Technologies</a>,<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> the NevSys contract
simply obligates the City to submit public records requests to NevSys
for review. The company has two days to object; if it does so, the
company has a week to file for a temporary restraining order to prevent
the release of documents and seek judicial review.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> The government
has a responsibility to the people to maintain control over its data and
the computing it does on their behalf, and must never cede control to
private vendors.</p>
<p>A tad simplistic, perhaps. Practical considerations and an aversion to
perceived risk mean that government IT projects often fall short of this
standard, although trends suggest that this is changing.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="preserving-public-access-to-government-data">Preserving public access to government data</h4>
<p>One pernicious effect of the reliance upon proprietary software is that
public records (data) may become <a href="http://www.courtnewsohio.gov/cases/2013/SCO/0307/121296.asp#.UkfmX4BXZFQ">“inextricably
intertwined”</a>
with the software and thus inaccessible to the public without paying for
the use of those programs.<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> Recently, in <em><a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S194708.PDF">Sierra Club v. County of
Orange</a></em> the
California Supreme Court unanimously overturned a 2011 appellate
decision <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news/government-can-charge-licensing-fees-gis-data">allowing agencies to charge licensing fees for GIS
data</a>.</p>
<p>Preserving public access requires that sunshine laws keep pace with
technological advances. Florida law provides an excellent <a href="http://www.myflsunshine.com/sun.nsf/sunmanual/d85cde087c3a6818852566f3007272ea">model
policy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>119.01 General state policy on public records.</strong></p>
<p>(a). Automation of public records must not erode the right of access
to those records. As each agency increases its use of and dependence
on electronic recordkeeping, each agency must provide reasonable
public access to records electronically maintained and must ensure
that exempt or confidential records are not disclosed except as
otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<p>(b). When designing or acquiring an electronic recordkeeping system,
an agency must consider whether such system is capable of providing
data in some common format such as, but not limited to, the American
Standard Code for Information Interchange.</p>
<p>(c). An agency may not enter into a contract for the creation or
maintenance of a public records database if that contract impairs the
ability of the public to inspect or copy the public records of the
agency, including public records that are on-line or stored in an
electronic recordkeeping system used by the agency.</p>
<p>(d). Subject to the restrictions of copyright and trade secret laws
and public records exemptions, agency use of proprietary software must
not diminish the right of the public to inspect and copy a public
record.</p>
<p>(e). Providing access to public records by remote electronic means is
an additional method of access that agencies should strive to provide
to the extent feasible. If an agency provides access to public records
by remote electronic means, such access should be provided in the most
cost-effective and efficient manner available to the agency providing
the information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The State of Connecticut’s Bureau of Enterprise Systems &amp; Technology
published <a href="http://www.ct.gov/best/cwp/view.asp?a=1244&amp;q=321652">system design
guidelines</a> to help
state agencies and municipalities to comply with <a href="http://www.state.ct.us/foi/2003FOIA/Sec.%201-211.htm">Connecticut’s FOIA
provisions relating to electronic public
records</a>.<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>
These include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Ability to access, manipulate and report data currently available
    in any applications which are being replaced with a minimum of
    “translation” or modification of tables, parameters, or other
    factors;</li>
<li>Clear identification of that information in the database which is
    not exempt from FOIA;</li>
<li>Use of separate tables for exempt and non-exempt data;</li>
<li>Use of a database which allows security at a field level;</li>
<li>Use of non-proprietary data structures and reporting tools;</li>
<li>Data “backups” which ensure availability, including catastrophic
    loss of primary data, disaster or business interruption;</li>
<li>Permanent copies of data stored on optical or other non
    destructible media where possible;</li>
<li>Compliance with any applicable standards-setting body for data
    creation, data sharing, management or communication in the field;</li>
<li>Source code ownership by the municipality or the State of
    Connecticut and source code escrow by the vendor;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These are both good places to start. The City of Las Vegas is headed in
the right direction; it established an <a href="http://lasvegas.opendata.junar.com/home/">open data
portal</a> as part of <a href="http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/Publications/28685.htm">its
participation</a> in
the <a href="http://www.hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>, and
posts its <a href="http://clvplaces.appspot.com/">GIS data</a> online as well. So
it seems that the problem here isn’t with the intentions of the City,
but with the approach that’s been taken thus far. Its announced open
data policies pertain to particular data sets, cherry picked by the
government, but leave the great majority of the data generated by its
day to day operations locked out of sight. The City must adopt
appropriate policies and guidelines to ensure that requirements for
future IT projects incorporate safeguards for citizens’ access to public
records.</p>
